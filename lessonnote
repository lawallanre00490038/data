CONTENT OF THE LESSON
LESSON 1 – INTRODUCTION TO CHANGES IN PLANTS 
CHANGES IN GROWING PLANTS
Plants grow when seeds or young plants are put in the ground to grow.
As the plant grows, changes such increase in height, width and the number of leaves take place.
 
Putting seeds in the ground to grow are not strange to the pupils.
The change in plants as they grow is called life cycle.
The plant life cycle consists of four stages; seed, sprout, small plant, and adult plant.
 
LESSON 2 – KINDS OF CHANGE IN PLANTS
1. Further discuss the kinds of changes that occurs in plants with respect to growth, leaf fall, flower and fruits, etc. using video clips. 
2. Guide the pupils to present each stage on the chart and their exercise books.
